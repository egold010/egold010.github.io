            I am a firm believer in the concept that for repetitive and mundane tasks, robots and computers are always better than people, especially when the tasks can be done at extremely high speeds by computers.

            Piano tiles is a game where black rectangles come from the top of the screen at an increasing speed. Each black rectangle clicked is a point and when either a wrong spot is clicked or a tile goes off the bottom of the screen, the game ends. Because the difficulty of the game comes from speed rather than complexity, I figured it would be the perfect game to make a bot to play it for me.

        <p class="content">
            I partially got inspiration for this project from youtuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CodeBullet" target="_blank">Code Bullet</a>.

            His bot reached around 10.6 clicks per second before losing, where mine reached around 37.3 clicks per second before losing.

        <h2 class="section">Development</h2>
        <p class="content">
            I created multiple versions of the bot in python and the final version in C#. I will include the major versions of the bots and issues with them.
        </p>
        <h3 class="category">Attempt 1</h3>
        <p class="content">
            The first attempt of the bot was made in python and was able to reach a score of around 1000. The first draft captured the whole screen, cut out the bounding box of the game, and clicked the first black pixel it saw (starting from top left and moving to bottom right).
        </p>
        <h3 class="category">Issues</h3>
        <p class="content">
            First and foremost, this bot processes the entire bounding box of the game, which is far more pixels than it needs and it significantly slows down the bot, so even if the bot could score points properly, it would still be far too slow. This was fixed in later versions of the bot, which would process less of the screen.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            The second problem is that since the bot clicks on the first black pixel it sees, it could click the tiles in the wrong order when the game gets fast enough that there are multiple tiles on the screen. This could have been solved by starting the search for a black pixel from the bottom instead of the top, but I already decided to go back to the drawing board because of the first problem.
        </p>
        <h3 class="category">Attempt 2</h3>
        <p class="content">
            The second attempt was also in python and it was able to unreliably reach up to 2000. It calls getpixel() from PIL four times, one for each column of the game. I also realized that the hold tiles actually have only a few pixels in them that are fully black, since it has a blue gradient. I changed it to check if the sum of the rgb values are less than 50. Each time one of the pixels is found, it would click that spot and then reset to the start of the loop.
        </p>
        <h3 class="category">Issues</h3>
        <p class="content">
            The only big issue is a result of the program running too fast. Sometimes, the bot would click the same spot twice because the tile sometimes has a short delay between when it gets clicked and when it disappears.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            My first solution to this issue is not allowing the bot to click the same column twice in a row. This solution works for some situations but not others. Some songs have two tiles at the same time, so it would just repeatedly click between them. Another flaw is that sometimes there could be two tiles in a row with a short pause between them.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            My second solution was just to add a delay after clicking before it could click again. I knew this wouldn’t be a final solution because a delay will limit the score. I realize that ideally, I would need multithreading so that I could separate the delays for each column, but I didn’t feel comfortable with threading in python, so I switched to C# after this attempt.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            A flaw in the design that isn’t noticeable is that after this version of the bot, I realized that PIL’s getpixel() screenshots the whole screen and then picks an individual pixel, so it would be faster to screenshot only once and use that for all four columns
        </p>
        <h3 class="category">Moving to C#</h3>
        <p class="content">
            I remade the previous bot using a delay for each column. The program would run in 4 threads, each thread screenshotting and processing the image. Generally, C# runs much faster than python, so I knew that already the bot would run faster and using delays didn’t take advantage of this. After I got the version of the bot with delays working, I went back to the drawing board to make one without delays.
        </p>
        <h3 class="category">Attempt 3</h3>
        <p class="content">
            I knew that the program would execute faster in C# than in python, but I didn’t expect it to execute so much faster. The much faster execution opened up better ways to prevent the bot from clicking the same tile twice. Initially in each thread, it would have a flag that would be set to true when a tile is clicked and false when it doesn’t detect a tile. This version got my high score of 8443 and showed me how much faster the C# version was.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            Since there were four separate threads that were all performing the most expensive operation and there were no more delays, I needed to combine these back into a single thread. I used four different flags and only one screen shot operation for all the columns. This is what I believe to be the optimal algorithm for a piano tiles bot.
        </p>
        <h3 class="category">Analysis</h3>
        <p class="content">
            Screen capture is by far the slowest operation in the bot. I looked into capturing only individual pixels instead of the whole screen, but it doesn’t seem like it would be possible without making my own video driver. The only way I can foresee making the bot faster is by making it in either C or assembly if possible.
