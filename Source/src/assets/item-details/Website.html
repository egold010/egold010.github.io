            At my internship and part time work at Seer, I became familiar with Angular, a technology used for web development. 
            I decided to make a website to act as a professional portfolio for professional use and to verify that I am able 
            to create an angular application from scratch.
            The repository for this website can be found <a href="https://github.com/egold010/website" target="_blank">here</a>
            and the components of the website can be found <a href="https://github.com/egold010/website/tree/main/Source/src/app" target="_blank">here</a>.
