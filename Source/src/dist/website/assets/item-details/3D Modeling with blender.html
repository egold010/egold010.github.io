        <h1 class="header">3D Modeling with blender</h1>
        <p class="subber">11/15/2022</p>
        <h3 class="section">Introduction</h3>
        <p class="content">I thought I could get through making games by just taking the basic shapes that are available in the development environment and putting them together to make creatures. I was very wrong.</p>
        <p class="content">The first ever creature I tried to make was a lizard. I made it in Roblox Studio and it did not turn out well, but I decided to use it anyway. As I saw more and more high quality games on Roblox, I realized that choppy looking creatures and swords with rectangular blades wouldn’t be able to compete with the creature design other games were using, so I decided to learn how to use blender.</p>
        <h3 class="section">Progression</h3>
        <p class="content">When most people learn blender, they follow a tutorial series starting with making a donut and adding toppings to it. I decided to just throw myself into the deep end and learn as I make what I need.</p>
        <h3 class="category">Trees</h3>
        <p class="content">I first had to make trees for a forest in a blender. I followed a video about low poly tree making and ended up with a tree that was essentially a green ball on a stick. For a considerable amount of time, I used these basic looking trees with the intent to replace them later.</p>
        <p class="content">I saw gameplay of the video game Genshin Impact, which had revolutionary graphics and was inspired to use ghibli style trees. I learned how to make ghibli trees from a video tutorial and they turned out excellently. Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like I’ll make a game using these trees in Roblox because the Roblox terrain has realistic textures and can’t be changed.</p>
        <h3 class="category">Slimes</h3>
        <p class="content">The first enemies I made were slimes, which are an extremely simple shape. Basically, they are just a sphere that has been flattened on one side and pulled out on the opposite side. I learned about textures and texture paint by giving the slimes a pattern to make them more interesting. I also learned about animating imported models in Roblox. I made 4 different slimes by coloring them differently and giving them different abilities in game, though they all had the same shape.</p>
        <h3 class="category">Others</h3>
        <p class="content">I made some weapons for one of the RPG games I was working on. Weapons are extremely versatile from a development standpoint because just by changing the color or effects on them, it is possible to make an item with a completely different feel. For example, changing the color of the blade from gray to red makes the weapon seem less basic and stronger. It is also possible to make the blade of the weapon glow or emit particles, giving it multiple dimensions of customization without changing the vertices.</p>
        <p class="content">One of the coolest things I made was an earth golem. I wanted to make a golem as a boss for one of my games, so I made an earth golem consisting of multiple disconnected stones forming the shape of a humanoid with a glowing core. I used sculpting for the shape of the stones, unaware of how many vertices it creates. When I finished, I tried exporting the model without looking at the vertex count, but it threw an error when importing into Roblox Studio because it had too many vertices. I checked the stats of the golem model and it had 1.6 million vertices. By using the decimate modifier, I was able to decrease the vertices to 12,000, but the model lost a lot of its resolution.</p>
        <h3 class="category">Dinosaurs</h3>
        <p class="content">After I started the Mecha-Raptor simulator, I immediately started working on modeling the dinosaurs. My plan was to make them using sculpting and then reduce the vertices with the decimate modifier just like with the earth golem. I found that the fingers were extremely difficult to make and the dinosaurs just didn’t turn out realistic with sculpting. Maybe if I practiced sculpting or had a drawing pad, they would have turned out better from sculpting. Applying the decimate modifier to the sculpted dinosaurs also caused some asymmetries and gave issues with texturing them.</p>
        <p class="content">I switched to using polygon extrusion and followed a video tutorial on how to make a velociraptor. Although polygon extrusion seems less intuitive than sculpting, the dinosaurs turned out much better. After I finished the velociraptor video, I knew how to make any creature using polygon extrusion, so I was able to make the rest of the dinosaurs I had planned using the same method. With polygon extrusion, most of the detail of the dinosaur will come from the texture, which I don’t know anything about. Learning how to texture creatures will be the next hurdle for me to overcome.</p>
