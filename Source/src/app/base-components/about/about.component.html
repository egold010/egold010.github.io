    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I'm an Electrical Engineering graduate from the University of California, Riverside, with a Master's degree
        focused on Machine Intelligence and autonomous systems. My academic background in both Electrical Engineering
        and Applied Mathematics (Physics) has shaped my ability to approach complex technical challenges with analytical
        precision and interdisciplinary insight.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm passionate about building intelligent machines that can perceive, decide, and act autonomously in dynamic
        environments. My experience spans robotics, computer vision, reinforcement learning, and embedded systems —
        enabling me to understand and contribute to intelligent systems across both hardware and software layers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Professionally, I've worked across startups, research labs, and industry roles, contributing to projects in
        SLAM, perception, and navigation pipelines. From integrating advanced localization algorithms at a robotics
        startup to leading autonomy development for a drone team, I bring a hands-on, full-cycle R&D mindset to every
        challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm always seeking opportunities to apply and grow these skills in meaningful, forward-thinking projects —
        whether in robotics, intelligent systems, or AI applications that create real-world impact.
