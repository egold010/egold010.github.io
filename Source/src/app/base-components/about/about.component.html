    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I'm a graduate student at the University of California, Riverside, pursuing a Master's degree in Electrical
        Engineering with an emphasis on Machine Intelligence. Before this, I completed my undergraduate studies in
        Applied Mathematics (Physics) — a foundation that shaped the way I approach complex systems with both analytical
        rigor and a curiosity for how things work at a fundamental level.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm deeply interested in autonomous systems — machines that can perceive, decide, and act in dynamic
        environments without constant human input. My coursework spans a wide range, from machine learning and computer
        vision to embedded systems, allowing me to understand intelligent systems from both
        software and hardware perspectives.
    </p>

        I've also worked on diverse software projects, ranging from data analysis to web development. These experiences
        have helped me develop a well-rounded technical skill set and an appreciation for the full development cycle —
        from low-level implementation to high-level design.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm currently seeking opportunities where I can apply and grow these skills — in research, development, or
        interdisciplinary collaboration. Whether it's in robotics, intelligent systems, or AI for good, I'm eager to
        contribute to projects that are forward-thinking, meaningful, and technically challenging.
